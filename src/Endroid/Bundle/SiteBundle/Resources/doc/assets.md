# Assets

## Tools

By default the application comes with a [Bower](http://bower.io/) and
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) configuration to manage assets and dependencies.
The installation and usage of these tools is found at their respective web sites.

## Installing dependencies

The first time you install the application you need to install the dependant
libraries and frameworks using the install command.

    bower install

## Running Grunt tasks

The default Grunt configuration instructs to combine and minify assets. You can
add extra tasks or sources to this configuration and rebuild the assets using
the default grunt command.

    grunt
